# Migrations

## Usage

### Adding a new migration
To add a new migration execute the following command:
```sh
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message"
```
Arguments:
* `-m` - new migration message;

The new migration will be added to `migrations/versions` directory.

for further details.

### Applying/reverting migrations in DV
Before applying or reverting migrations, make sure that DB connection env vars
are configured.

```sh
alembic upgrade head  # execute all migrations
# in order to execute a subset of migrations,
# replace `head` with the revision ID of the last target migration.
```

```sh
alembic downgrade base  # revert all migrations
# in order to revert a subset of migrations,
# replace `base` with the revision ID of the last target migration.
```

### Applying/reverting migrations in PROD
For production deployment it is required to generate raw sql migration (offline migration), verity it
and then apply to db.

```sh
alembic upgrade 128411c0b2c8:c2bdf99dcb8b --sql > migration.sql # generate offline migration
```

```sh
PGPASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD} psql -h ${DB_HOST} -p ${DB_PORT} -U ${DB_USERNAME} -d ${DB_NAME} < migration.sql # apply migration
```
